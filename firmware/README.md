# Firmware

Includes two modifications:

- [PHTS RC-01]
- [PHTS RC-02]

## Development

In order to properly compile libraries in sketch files set _Sketchbook location_ (_File > Preferences_) to "firmware" folder path.
You can keep _IRremote_ and _SimpleTimer_ libraries in this folder or in global Arduino's folder.

[phts rc-01]: ./RC-01
[phts rc-02]: ./RC-02
